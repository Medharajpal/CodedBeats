# Coded Beats 

## General Information
My idea was to show how Python can be used by people with an interest in music to build proper melodies using just loops, notes, and patterns.
The project demonstrates how loops, lists, and timing logic can generate structured rhythm and harmony — recreating part of *Radiohead’s “All I Need”* purely through code.  
The audio and structure are **inspired by Radiohead’s track “All I Need”.

## Features
- Built entirely in **TunePad**, a browser-based Python platform for music coding.  
- Uses **loops, lists, and timing logic** to create layered rhythm and melody.  
- Demonstrates the **modulo operator (%)** for rhythmic pattern control.  
- Four musical layers: keyboard chords, bassline, drums, and melody.  


## Code Dependencies
- **TunePad Built-in Library** – provides core functions such as 'playNote()` and `beats`.  
- **Python 3 Syntax** – uses native loops (`for`), conditionals (`if`), and lists.  
- No external installations or downloads required.  
- `%` (modulo) timing logic adapted from *Van Schooneveld (n.d.)*, Real Python.  


## How to Run

2. Log in or create a free TunePad account.
3. Click **Projects** → **Import Project**.
4. Upload the file named `tunepad_project_117860.json` from this repository.
5. Once imported, open the project in TunePad.
6. Press **Play All** to hear the full composition.

## Usage
This project is for educational and purposes only. 
All code and commentary are original student work for the University of Technology Sydney.  


## Room for Improvement
If I continued developing this project, I would:
- Experiment with more dynamic instruments and harmonies to create greater depth.
- Integrate real-time interaction, such as changing tempo through code variables.
